Homework

1) List five things that you Googled as you made your way through the vignette and the answers you received.

2) List two questions that are more appropriate for asking the instructor and I will try to answer them.

Optional, but encouraged:

Let me know if something in the vignette could be clarified or if there is a typo. Really any suggestions for improvement are welcome.
