# Week 5: ATAC-seq

In these 3 lectures you will learn about [chromatin accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epigenomics#Chromatin_accessibility_assays) and the [ATAC-seq protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATAC-seq). We will go through a few of the first steps for analyzing ATAC-seq data, and I'll show you how to do a few types of downstream analysis, too.

## Assignment

The [assignment](assignment.md) will be due in 1 week.
